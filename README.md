# RockPaperScissor
In this project I am going to make a RockPaperScissor game, where two users are going to compete. One user will be the computer itself and other will be the end user. It is a console based game using javascript. 
Key concepts of JavaScript used in this project are:
1. Functions (mathematical functions like, Math.random(), Math.floor()etc).
2. Conditional Statements (if, else).
3. Other operators.
